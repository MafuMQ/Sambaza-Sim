# TODO break down value added & final demand

# there is two types of breakdowns, raw breakdowns with values, and simply just totals with percentages
# regard the known transformation constraints i.e. consumer spending cannot be higher than total wages etc.

# final demand directs production, therefore absolute value added will depend on the amount of final demand,
# we are assuming all of value added is immediately spent as a final demand, as we did so in the transformation
# models. If money is saved, e.g. by the employees, there is actaully less household consumption (C), the figures
# still remain in the model though, representing a future reserve for a future purchase. Not conserving this may
# be used to show/demonstrate inflation/deflation. How?. 

# TODO apply and evaluate investment/change (also be able to apply tax and tarrifs) 1, without breakdown 2, with breakdown
# TODO rank investments based on evaluated result
# TODO friendly for business and soverign fiscal

# We can evaluate/imply value added from the table from the total output and intermediate inputs
# For now, we demonstrate improvements on the technology, what it has on the output and economy
# First the raw inputs, capital saving improvements
# Then, we demonstrate labour saving improvements (nothing will change for now, we demonstrate this on second section)

# we must then break down added value and final demand, to demonstrate the impact of both capital and labour saving improvements
# finally, we simulate saving and investment
# we'll start by "applying" the change to an io table
